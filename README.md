# Preparing your machine

Make sure your system has all the required tools for use e.g Python 3 and pip environments.

# Steps to be followed

Start by making the folder in which the API will be implimented. Simply Open your terminal and type:

```
mkdir SENDIT-API
```

Afterwhich we go into the folder by typing the code:

```
cd SENDIT-API
```

## Create a Virtual Environment for our Project

Create a virtual environment by typing:

```
virtualenv -p python3 .
```

We are required to activate the virtual environment before we install our projects requirements. You can do that by typing:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Clone and Configure a Flask Project

Login into your github account and open the project folder then follow the instruction on how to clone the existing project.

```
git clone https://github.com/AlvinLusenaka/SENDIT-API.git
```

Now you can then install the requirements by typing:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Unit Testing

   ### Tools:
